# MemeLib (ML)

- ML is an open source C++ game engine.
- Downloads: https://bit.ly/ml_noobs
- Old Repo: https://github.com/Gurman8r/CppSandbox
- ML uses OpenGL 4.6
	- Try updating your graphics drivers if you're having difficulties.
- Building for Windows with VS2019
	- If you already have VS2019 installed on your system the VC++ runtime library is also most likely installed, else you can download it here:
	- https://www.itechtics.com/microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-versions-direct-download-links/
- ML uses Python 3.9.
	- I only included the libraries needed to get going
	- Python libraries can be added to the python/Lib folder, or the home path can be changed in ML.ini
	- Additional encodings can be found in python/Lib/encodings/encodings.7z
