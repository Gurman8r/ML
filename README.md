# MemeLib (ML)

MemeLib is an open source C++ game engine.

Downloads: https://bit.ly/ml_noobs

Old Repo: https://github.com/Gurman8r/CppSandbox

Currently ML is Windows only. I eventually plan on porting it to Emscripten.

ML uses OpenGL 4.6. Try updating your graphics drivers if you're having difficulties.
