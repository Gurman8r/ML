# MemeLib (ML)

ML is an open source C++ game engine.

Downloads: https://bit.ly/ml_noobs

Old Repo: https://github.com/Gurman8r/CppSandbox

ML uses OpenGL 4.6. Try updating your graphics drivers if you're having difficulties.

Currently building for Windows with VS2019. 
If you already have VS2019 installed on your system the VC++ runtime library is also most likely installed, otherwise you can download it here.
